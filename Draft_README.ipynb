    "In order to answer this question, I have developed a convolutional neural network from scratch using only NumPy. The network has been tested on images from CIFAR-10, with classification accuracy as the evaluation metric. Rather than building the fastest or best network, the goal of building this library is to gain intuitions, test concepts, and document steps as thoroughly as possible. Code comments and explanations will be numerous. There will likely be mistakes, which will be improve over time. Feedback is welcome!\n",
